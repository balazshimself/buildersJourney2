  "plan": "<p><strong>Local Restaurant Direct Ordering Platform</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong><br />\nIndependent restaurants struggle with high delivery fees from platforms like DoorDash and UberEats, which can consume 15-30% of their profits. Additionally, many small family-owned restaurants lack the resources for professional website development, leaving them unable to compete with larger chains that dominate online ordering. Customers wish to support local businesses, yet find it difficult to discover and order directly from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nCreate a commission-free delivery platform where restaurants are charged a fixed monthly fee (e.g., $49/month) instead of a percentage of each order. This approach reduces financial risk for less-established restaurants. The platform will also offer delivery drivers for an additional fee, allowing restaurants to maintain flexibility while providing a modern, user-friendly interface for customers to order directly from their favorite local spots.</p>\n<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong><br />\nSmall, family-owned restaurants with fewer than 10 employees and only one location. Marketing will be direct, focusing on personal outreach to restaurant owners, with an incentive of 3 months of free service to encourage sign-ups and build initial relationships.</p>\n<p><strong>Financials:</strong><br />\nThe revenue model will be based on subscription fees from restaurants. Initial funding will come from investments to cover startup costs. As the platform gains traction and builds a solid customer base, the subscription model will sustain ongoing operations and support further enhancements.</p>"
