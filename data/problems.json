      "title": "Action Camera Market Gap",
      "description": "YCombinator has identified a significant market gap in the action camera industry. The current market leader, GoPro, primarily targets extreme sports enthusiasts and professional athletes, leaving a substantial portion of potential users untapped.",
      "marketAnalysis": "The action camera market has been dominated by GoPro with a 42% market share. Their products are priced between $199-$499, with the primary target audience being extreme sports enthusiasts (snowboarders, surfers, skydivers). Our research shows that there's a growing interest in action cameras from everyday consumers for family activities, travel experiences, and casual outdoor adventures. These consumers find current offerings expensive, overly complex, and intimidating. Additionally, there's minimal innovation in specialized use cases beyond sports, such as pet monitoring, educational recording, and everyday life documentation. Battery life, ease of use, and seamless content sharing remain pain points for the majority of users. Your task is to design a product strategy targeting this untapped market segment with a unique value proposition."
