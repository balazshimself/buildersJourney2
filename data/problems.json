      "title": "Local Event Discovery Gap",
      "description": "People in mid-sized cities struggle to discover local events, workshops, and activities happening in their area. Event organizers, especially for niche interests (pottery classes, book clubs, hiking groups), have difficulty reaching their target audience beyond social media posts that get lost in feeds.",
      "marketAnalysis": "Event discovery is solved well in major cities through platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup, but mid-sized cities (50K-500K population) are underserved. Local newspapers are declining, Facebook event discovery is poor for organic reach, and Instagram posts are easily missed. Our research in 10 mid-sized cities found that 67% of residents say they 'miss out on local events they would have attended if they knew about them.' Event organizers report that 80% of their marketing effort goes to social media with low engagement rates. The market includes 300+ mid-sized cities in the US, with local event organizers (gyms, community centers, small businesses, hobby groups) willing to pay $15-30/month for better reach. Current solutions are either too broad (Eventbrite) or require high user adoption (Meetup). There's an opportunity for a locally-focused, easy-to-use platform that helps both discovery and simple event management for small organizers."
